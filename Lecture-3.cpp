/* What are variables and constants?
A constant does not change its value over time.
 A variable, on the other hand, changes its value dependent on the equation. 
 Constants are usually written in numbers. Variables are specially written in letters or symbols.
  Constants usually represent the known values in an equation, expression or in line of programming*/

/*how will the computer identify the kind of input we give in c++ ?
The cin object in C++ is used to accept the input from the standard input device i.e., keyboard. 
it is the instance of the class istream. It is associated with the standard C input stream stdin. 
The extraction operator(>>) is used along with the object cin for reading inputs. 
The extraction operator extracts the data from the object cin which is entered using the keyboard*/

/*how will the computer store the input we give ?
When you enter data into a computer, it is temporarily stored in the computer's Random Access Memory (RAM). 
RAM is a type of volatile memory that provides fast and temporary storage for data that the computer is actively using*/
